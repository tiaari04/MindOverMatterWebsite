FocusFuel combines brainwave analysis with real-time feedback to help optimize productivity and prevent burnout. Using the Muse 2 headband, the app captures brainwave data and calculates the Beta/Alpha ratio to assess focus levels. When your focus dips below the optimal threshold, FocusFuel sends a desktop notification prompting you to take a break. The app then offers scientifically-backed techniques, like meditation exercises, puzzles, and creative painting tools, to help you recharge. Once you're ready to return to work, the app notifies you to refocus.

We built FocusFuel by integrating the Muse 2 headband with our custom web app, processing EEG data through Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to extract meaningful insights into mental states. Our real-time feedback loop guides users through their workflow, ensuring they take breaks at the right moments for maximum productivity.

Looking ahead, we plan to incorporate machine learning to personalize recommendations based on each userâ€™s unique brainwave patterns, and expand FocusFuel with additional productivity tools. By combining neuroscience and technology, FocusFuel offers a smarter way to work, balancing effort with recovery for sustainable focus and performance.
